# AI-for-Wheat-Disease
As part of my University RA, I developed a Deep Learning model capable of detecting diseased wheat leaves amongst the healthy ones with favourable scores and help the user(mostly farmers) classify the healthy vs diseased wheat plants.

# Dataset
The [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OHKtwD1UrdmhqxrpQEeF_X_pqKotxRGD) contains 4800 images in total with
- 1279 Healthy Wheat
- 939 Wheat Loose Smut
- 1622 Leaf Rust
- 960 (after refining) Crown and Root Rot

# Model
A new type of technique has been utilised (by browsing multiple sources) of classifying each type of plant image into a binary array (4 arrays used) for a favourable and easy classification portrayal alongside using Neural Networks.

For a small cycle of 30 epochs only (faster model result check), a favourable score of 87.31% accuracy has been achieved.
